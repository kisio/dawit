# Node.js and Express web application
# Overview <br>
 This repository contains the solution for the task of building a basic web application using Node.js and the Express framework. The application fetches data from a public API and displays it on a web page. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a server-side application with data fetching and rendering capabilities.
# Problem Description <br>
The task involves the following steps: <br>
Set up a new Node.js project and use the Express framework to create a basic server. <br>
Choose a public API and ensure that data can be fetched from it using HTTP requests. <br>
Create a route in the application to serve an HTML page. <br>
Fetch data from the chosen API asynchronously and render it on the HTML page. <br>
# Repository Structure <br>
The repository is organized into separate folders to maintain a clear structure: <br>
src/ - Contains the Node.js application files <br>
routes/ - Contains the route definitions for the application endpoints <br>
controllers/ - Contains the controller classes for handling the data fetching and rendering <br>
# Usage
