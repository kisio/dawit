#  Implementing a RESTful API using Laravel
# Overview
This repository contains the solution for the task of creating a simple RESTful API using Laravel. The API allows users to perform CRUD operations on a resource called "tasks". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a basic API with authentication and validation middleware.

# Problem Description

The task involves the following steps: <br>
-Set up a new Laravel project and create a "Task" model with fields like title, description, and status. <br>
-Implement the necessary routes and controller methods to handle the CRUD operations for tasks. <br>
-Create a new task <br>
-Retrieve a specific task by ID <br>
-Update an existing task<br>
-Delete a task<br>
-Use middleware to handle authentication for the API. Only authenticated users should be able to access the CRUD operations.<br>
-Implement validation middleware to ensure that the incoming data meets the required criteria.<br>
# Repository Structure
The repository is organized into separate folders to maintain a clear structure:<br>
app/ - Contains the Laravel application files<br>
routes/ - Contains the route definitions for the API endpoints<br>
controllers/ - Contains the controller classes for handling the CRUD operations<br>
middlewares/ - Contains the middleware classes for authentication and validation<br>
# Usage
To use this API, follow these steps:<br>
Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
Set up a new Laravel project by running the necessary installation commands.<br>
Configure the database connection in the .env file.<br>
Migrate the database tables using the Laravel migration command.<br>
Start the Laravel development server.<br>
Use a tool like Postman to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints.<br>
